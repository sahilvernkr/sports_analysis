table in the memory:\n* Define which tables to use, and connect them (FROM + JOIN)\n* Keep only the rows that apply to the conditions (WHERE)\n* Group the data by the required level (if need) (GROUP BY)\n* Choose what information you want to have in the new table. It can have just rawdata (if no grouping), or combination of dimensions (from the grouping), and metrics\nNow, you chose that to show from the table:\n* Order the output of the new table (ORDER BY)\n* Add more conditions that would filter the new created table (HAVING) \n* Limit to number of rows - would cut it according the soring and the having filtering (LIMIT)\n","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dc398357-9a0c-46db-ba76-1f9d07b93b41","_uuid":"dbd4ef350896497e1f11d0023fce9810300a45b2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Sub Queries and Functions used below\n\n","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f17cbfb9-d25c-4597-887a-6114eddda250","_uuid":"fd444f1cf990ec5cc42c889a65cabff0f1353d27"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"players_height = pd.read_sql(\"\"\"SELECT CASE\n                                        WHEN ROUND(height)<165 then 165\n                                        WHEN ROUND(height)>195 then 195\n                                        ELSE ROUND(height)\n                                        END AS calc_height, \n                                        COUNT(height) AS distribution, \n                                        (avg(PA_Grouped.avg_overall_rating)) AS avg_overall_rating,\n                                        (avg(PA_Grouped.avg_potential)) AS avg_potential,\n                                        AVG(weight) AS avg_weight \n                            FROM PLAYER\n                            LEFT JOIN (SELECT Player_Attributes.player_api_id, \n                                        avg(Player_Attributes.overall_rating) AS avg_overall_rating,\n                                        avg(Player_Attributes.potential) AS avg_potential  \n                                        FROM Player_Attributes\n                                        GROUP BY Player_Attributes.player_api_id) \n                                        AS PA_Grouped ON PLAYER.player_api_id = PA_Grouped.player_api_id\n                            GROUP BY calc_height\n                            ORDER BY calc_height\n                                ;\"\"\", conn)\nplayers_height","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cda7c6ea-33af-4155-a2fa-93548aef12e7","_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_uuid":"c0620891169bb5ea3d0de4f800737f40a93c6b03","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-21T10:56:51.938625Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-21T10:56:51.938951Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-21T10:56:52.531694Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-21T10:56:51.938892Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-21T10:56:52.530878Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"players_height.plot(x=['calc_height'],y=['avg_overall_rating'],figsize=(12,5),title='Potential vs Height')","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3c06ab2d-d93c-4cf0-a8b8-55df5753e24f","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"391bd233403a29cc9be121f12afcaeae83a20952","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-21T10:56:52.533007Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-21T10:56:52.533250Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-21T10:56:52.701459Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-21T10:56:52.533207Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-21T10:56:52.700643Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]}]}
